Initialized repo and set up infrastructure (folders) 
Added sample lines from three poets: Vergil, Horace, Catullus
built preprocess for cleaning data. 
kept macrons in text:
    Thought process: 
        Macrons show vowel length, which is fundamental when analyzing latin poetry
        different poets use different metrical patters, which often depend on macrons for us as English speakers to discern more easily


11/14/2025
collect more data (lines of poetry) for the authors, aim for a couple thousand lines
basic training.py implemented
decided to go with no macrons since not all texts include them
